    "\n",
    "**Description:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming tools are now a standard feature within GIS software packages and allow professionals to automate, speed up, and become more precise in their analytic work. This workshop is designed for GIS professionals and students who have little to no experience or exposure to computer programming. Core programming concepts related to GIS work will be presented using the Python programming language. The workshop will be focused on guiding attendees through hands-on modules designed to provide the essential skills to programmatically manipulate data as part of a GIS workflow. This workshop is designed to be preparation for the afternoon workshop on Getting Started with Python in ArcGIS but may be taken independently.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Specific Topics Include:**\n",
    "* Core programming concepts\n",
    "* Working with CSV files within Python\n",

    "    * <a href=\"https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/\" target=\"_blank\">JetBrains PyCharm Community Edition</a> *NOTE:* This IDE requires admin privileges to install.\n",
    "    * IDLE is also shipped with ArcGIS for Desktop, so it can also be used\n",
